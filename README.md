# Microservices with ASP.NET Core 3

This project focuses on implementing a microservices architecture using ASP.NET Core 3 and other key technologies. Below are the highlights:

## Features

- **CQRS Pattern:** Implementation of the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern to separate write and read operations.

- **Unit Testing:** Emphasis on unit testing to ensure code quality.

- **Token-Based Authentication (JWT):** Secure authentication implementation using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

- **API Gateway:** Exploration of implementing an API Gateway to manage and route requests to microservices.

## Requirements

- Proficiency in .NET Core and API development.

## Description

This project centers around the implementation of a microservices architecture using ASP.NET Core 3, CQRS, unit testing, and JWT-based authentication. It also explores the implementation of an API Gateway for managing requests to the microservices.
